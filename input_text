This is a test text file that we will try to compress.
The process of compression, also called encoding will create a file
that we will then decompress to obtain the same file.
The algorithm, originally proposed by Huffman, creates a tree of
symbols, where symbols that appear more frequently are encoded
using fewer number of bits. The input file is then reread, and
each symbol is replaced by the bit encoding to achieve the compression.
The input file can contain extended ASCII characters, including UPPER
CASE, and also numbers like 1234567890, and also punctuations like
!@#$%^&*()_+-={}[]\|:;"'<>/?
The decompression process reverses this entire exercise, creating a
tree from the metadata stored in the compressed file. This tree
helps identify the code for each symbol, which is then written to
the output file to get the original file back.
In some cases, the last line is not being decoded back correctly.
